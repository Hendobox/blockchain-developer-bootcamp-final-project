### NFT Staking Platform

The idea behind this project is to give extra value to the holders of specifit NFT contracts. They will be able to stake it to gain ERC20 token rewards. With this, there will be more value to the NFT tokens since holders can gain rewards for staking it. 

1. There will be 3 smart contracts which will include; ERC20 token, Registry, and Staking.

2. The ERC20 contract is the underlying token of the project

3. The Registry contract will be used by the platform admin to whitelist NFT contracts whose tokens are stakable

4. The Staking contract will intract with the Registry and token contracts to determine which NFT contracts are stakable, and also to give the appropriate token rewards 

5. Users who own NFTs from whitelisted NFT contracts in the registry will be able to stake their NFTs and earn underlying ERC20 tokens in the process
